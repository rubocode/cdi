## Introduction

Software design often looks like a black art.
Some people are really good at it while others create complicated messes.
The discipline is young (a few decades) and the products are infinitely malleable.
Given a particular program to write — theoretically (as proved by _Alan Turing_) —
there are infinite ways to do it.

For the programmer, design is an essential prerequisite to understand and
organize complexity in the system.
From high-level design to low-level details, you are always figuring out
where to place a particular piece of state (data) or a functionality.
Your goal is to have clarity, the right semantics and conceptual integrity.

Often, programmers start from an understanding of a particular programming
language and its abstractions and proceeed with the design and coding.
However, when you're trying to do something new — not run of the mill — you
often need to choose the language based on your intended system and its nature.
You can't start from a language, you have to start with a design.
You might end up creating a new language (_c_, _c++_ and [_go_](/go) come to mind).

What we need is a highly congruent conceptual abstraction that helps
us position state and functionality across the system.
The conjecture here is that we can do this very successfully by conceptualizing
a given system as one of Collaborative Distributed Intelligence (CDI).

We explore how this applies to software design from very fundamental
elements to language abstractions.
It helps to think of this as an exercise in language design focusing on semantics.
The end result is that you will be able to utilize an existing
programming language better as well as design your computing elements —
data, functions, classes and modules with accuracy, stability and endurance.

What you do when you create a program is essentially creating a new language
to express your problem space and your solution space.
With a good grasp of your context and a coherent bird's eye view, you will
be able to organize the intelligence in your systems much better.
