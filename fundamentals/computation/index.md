As mentioned before, we constrain ourselves to a Von Neumann Architecture allowing for
multiple processors.
It is useful to take the anthropomorphic perspective here.  Let's consider any of
our intelligences as an agent.  Let's also consider the _CPU_ as an agent.
Now let's think of agents as humans.  It is much easier to visualize the abstraction
this way.
