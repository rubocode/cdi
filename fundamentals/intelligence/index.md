## Intelligence

Humans create mental models to make sense of the world.
The thing is that different people experience the world differently.
You shift your perspective and now you see the world in a whole
new way.  This is why philosophers have tried for centuries to
search for the truth.  They had the hope not to be troubled by
a whole new different perspective.  These can be rather unsettling.
Human progress, however, has depended in major paradigm shifts.
Yet, some ideas still endure — such as Platonic forms.
It seems a fundamental idea.

In this exploration, we take the fundamental element of a system
as ***a node of intelligence***.  This is a higher-level abstraction
of an active component that is alive.
Active means that it will initiate action — it has agency.
Alive means that its internal state can change without provocation.

This is quite a bit different from an object-oriented view which
— for our purposes — is essentially an encapsulation mechanism.
It is worth remebering that we view objects as passive.
Someone needs to send a message to an object for it to do something.

We also take a higher view than thinking of computation as
a combination of data and functions.
In practical terms it is, but in terms of what we want to model
it is not.

We take the analogous situation of our conception of the atom.
While we know that electrons, protons, neutrons and other
constituents exist, we take the fundamental unit to be an atom.
Yes, data and functions are fundamental in computing.
But, we choose to operate at the level of ***a node of intelligence***
as the fundamental unit.
We will explore the ramifications.
