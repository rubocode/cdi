It is quite a useful thing in understanding a system to assign a boundary
to the system.  Then we can characterize the system using its interactions
with things outside the system.  And then, we can think of these things
outside the original system also as separate distinct systems.
We stand outside all of these systems and try to understand the interactions
between the whole set of systems.

When we design a system, we get to partition the computing elements in
the system across multiple subsystems.
A coherent system is a result of capturing the essentials — in a
sense Platonic forms — so that the captured abstraction is stable and durable.

Technically, each of the subsystems can contains its own subsystems and so on.
It is silly to impose restrictions on how deep the nesting continues.
In a real life system, this is part of the design and the architecture of
the system.  It is always trutles all the way down, only now, you are the one
placing the turtles!

Here, we restrict ourselves to _Computing_ and _Langauge Design_.
We don't worry about the Solar System, Physics or Chemistry.
We are in the business of capturing abstractions that we can use
for computational activity.

We also restrict ourselves to the _Von Neumann Architecture_.
While this exploration may become useful for the folks in
_Qunatum Computing_, we don't bother with that.
We would be overextending ourselves.

This is an exercise in reflection, consolidation, crystallization in
retrospect as opposed to envisioning a new computing paradigm or attempting
to create a new civilization on Mars.
Instead, we focus on the fundamentals!
